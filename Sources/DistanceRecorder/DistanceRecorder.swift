/// `DistanceRecorder` is intended to be used for recording location where the participant is walking,
/// running, cycling, or other activities **outdoors** where the distance travelled is of interest. By
/// default, this recorder *only* logs the relative distance, altitude, course, and speed travelled by
/// the participant. To log GPS coordinates, the configuration file must *explicitly* be set to do so,
/// and it is recommended to *only* log the coordinates if the user is a tester in order to ensure the
/// participant's privacy is respected.
///
/// At the end of the motion travelled step, the recorder also uses CoreMotion to query the pedometer
/// for the overall distance and step count as measured by the pedometer, which are then added to the
/// `CollectionResult` returned by this recorder when it is stopped.
///
/// This recorder is only available on iOS devices. CoreMotion is not supported by other platforms.
/// Additionally, for a watchOS application that needs to measure distance travelled, creating an
/// HKWorkoutSession offers a more efficient use of the device battery with equivalent accuracy
/// in determining the distance travelled by the participant while performing a distance measuring
/// activity.
///
/// This recorder is designed to be run in the background so that the user can lock the screen and place
/// the phone in their pocket or bag. This requires setting the capabilities in your app to include
/// background audio.
///
/// Additionally, you will need to add the privacy permission for location and motion sensors to the
/// application `Info.plist` file. As of this writing (syoung 02/08/2018), those keys are:
/// - `Privacy - Motion Usage Description`
/// - `Privacy - Location Always and When In Use Usage Description`
/// - `Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description`

/// - note: **Both** location privacy keys are required.
